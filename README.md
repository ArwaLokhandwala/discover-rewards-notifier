## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
The extension comes with the latest Discover速 Deals and Cashback Rewards data, so you don't have to download those manually.

TODO see other sections for notes on TODO

### Prerequisites

You'll need:

- `git` to clone the repo and make contributions
- `npm` to compile the UI
- `Chrome Web Browser` to test the extension

### Installing

#### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nareddyt/discover-rewards-notifier.git
cd discover-rewards-notifier/
```

#### Install `npm` dependencies

```
npm install
```

#### Compile *handlebars templates* using `npm`

[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) is a templating engine the extension uses for the UI.
Note that the previous step automatically installed the handlebars CLI.

```
npm run compileTemplates
```

#### Load the extension in your `Chrome Web Browser`

The extension is now fully-built and ready. Follow the short list of steps from the [Chrome Developer Guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) under the **Load the extension** section.

**Note:** You'll see a special *developer icon* when you load the extension. This helps differentiate between the production extension and the developers' custom builds.

## Testing the build

We have no automated tests yet :)

### Manual testing

Ensure you can view deals and cashback rewards on various sites.
Using your `Chrome Web Browser`, go to various retailers to see if the extension recognizes the deal or cashback reward.

Look through `data/deals.json` and `data/cashbacks.json` and ensure that the extension properly displays offers for at least 5 of the sites.

Try finding a site that has both a deal and a cashback reward. Ensure the extension displays both of them.

### Codacy

We use Codacy to check code style. Codacy automatically runs every time a pull request is submitted.

Sometimes it will be very picky, so feel free to only fix the most obvious errors it finds.
