## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
The extension comes with the latest Discover速 Deals and Cashback Rewards data, so you don't have to download those manually.

For information on how the deals and cashback data is obtained and processed, view the **Obtaining and Processing the Data** section.

For information on Continuous Deployment, view the **Continuous Deployment** section.

### Prerequisites

You'll need:

- `git` to clone the repo and make contributions
- `npm` to install developer dependencies and build the extension
- `Chrome Web Browser` to test the extension

### Installing

#### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nareddyt/discover-rewards-notifier.git
cd discover-rewards-notifier/
```

#### Install `npm` dependencies

Run the command below to install the packages needed to build the extension.

**Note:** We use npm to manage *developer* dependencies. None of these dependencies are required when running the extension as a regular user.

```
npm install
```

#### Compile *handlebars templates* using `npm`

[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) is a templating engine the extension uses for the UI. Run the command below to compile the required templates.

```
npm run compileTemplates
```

#### Load the extension in Chrome

The extension is now fully-built and ready to use. It needs to be loaded into the Chrome Web Browser so you can use it.

Follow the short list of steps from the [Chrome Developer Guide](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) under the **Load the extension** section.

The extension should work now!

**Note:** You'll see a special *developer icon* when you load the extension. This helps differentiate between the production build and the developers' custom builds.
